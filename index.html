	<p>Hi, I am Fenil. I am a pre-final year student at BITS Pilani K.K. Birla Goa Campus. I am double majoring in B.E.(Hons) Computer Science and Msc.(Hons.) Economics. I love computers, networks and statistics. I like to build stuff that scales and reaches people. Hit me up if theres some cool idea.
	</br>
	</br>
	I love to write on topics like systems, storage & statistical learning among others. Apart from tech I also write just to vent, the blog is titled <strong>Sugar Coated</strong> as I try to make the blogs soft and easy to read, but it often doesnt happen so. You can check em out at <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">here</a>.  You can checkout my projects <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">here</a> and and my cv <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">here.</a></p></div><br>.</p>
